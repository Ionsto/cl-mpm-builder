# CLOG tutorial

To use your installed QuickLisp

bash run-ql / run-ql.bat  - run the clog-builder for this project if using QuickLisp

Use: (ql:update-all-dists) to update QuickLisp for latest libraries and clog


To use OCICL setup before (install OCICL if needed)

bash setup-ocicl / setup-ocicl.bat - setup project to use ocicl - see
                        https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog/blob/main/OCICL.md

                        setup-ocicl is also used to redownload the systems listed
                        in system.cvs that would be stored in git and no need to
                        keep the systems directory there. 

bash run-ocicl / run-ocicl.bat - run the clog-builder for this project if using ocicl

bash update-ocicl / update-ocicl.bat - update the libraries and clog to the latest version
